    <p>
      Here are some blogs and websites I enjoy reading on a regular basis and find inspiring. They
      are all such great content creators (i know, I hate that term too) and I'm always learning
      something new every time one of their posts drop into my rss reader or inbox. Check them out
      for great content on web development, design, music, politics, technology and more.

        ><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> This list of blogs will most likely be updated infinitely since there are
        so many fantastic and creative writers out there and I can't possibly have discovered them all
        yet. With that said: go and feed your brain!</i
