  <h3>So, you want to know more about who I am?</h3>
  <p>
    My name is <b>Sonny Stark</b> and I'm happy to welcome you to this part of the internet. What are
    the odds that you found this place among all the billions and billions of websites?
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a Swedish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expatriate" target="_blank">expat</a> who's
    currently residing in Leipzig, Germany for the past 8 years. <em>Toll, oder</em>? I'm passionate
    about personal growth, both mentally and intellectually, and I have a deep interest in web
    development and design. My musical preference tends to lean towards the dark and aggressive side
    and I have always found it both therapeutic and liberating to listen to that kind of music, but
    also to write and perform it. It's immersive, confrontational, and healing all at once—truly
    magical. History and religion are two other fields that I have a huge interest in.
  </p>
  <h3>What I do?</h3>
  <p>
    I read. Exploring anything and everything that has to do with history, be it pre-history,
    medieval Europe or the cold war, I'll devour it. I know it's a cliché but I do love travelling
    and subject myself to new places and cultures. It's truly fantastic and so educational. Coding
    and building little projects, mainly. Hanging out with some of my favorite people and I try to
    spend as much time as I possibly can with <i>the</i> most important person in my life because she
    makes everything feel amazing and positive. That alone is not a small feat given the world we are
    living in. Am I right? Music, of course, is a constant companion in my life.
  </p>
  <h3>What you will find here?</h3>
  <p>
    This space is a reflection of my experiences, discoveries, and passions. You'll find a mix of
    personal anecdotes, insights, and topics that excite me. I believe in the freedom that comes
    with having a blog, so I'll write about whatever inspires me. Feel free to explore, or if you
    prefer, you can always come back later. This is a place for me to share and connect with others
    who might find my journey interesting.
  </p>
  <h3>That's it!</h3>
  <p>
    So, I will just drop my contact info stuff down below and wish you a good day. Who knows, maybe
    we will strike up a conversation about JavaScript one day, or maybe lose ourselves in a chat
    about the tragic demise of the ancient Carthaginian Empire, or discuss the latest Cannibal
    Corpse album. Time will tell. Either way, thanks for taking your time to read through all this
    and see you around.
  </p>

  <h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2>
  <h3>Inspiration and tech</h3>
  <p>
    I did a lot of research before I started building this site and I spent a considerably long time
    fleshing out the design and theme I wanted. Let's say that I had a very specific look and feel
    in mind and I think that if you would imagine a conjugation of <strong>Star Wars</strong> and <strong
      >The Simpsons</strong
    >, I'd say that you are pretty close. Maybe with a small pinch of Michael Jackson's <a
      href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095655/"
      target="_blank">"Moonwalker"</a
    >
    <em>(the movie)</em>. In other words: an aesthetic representation of growing up during late 80's
    and early 90's.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do think that this <i>retro</i> style is done to death a bit so I didn't want to overdo it either.
    In all honesty, I just wanted to get as far away as possible from all the millions of dev portfolios
    riddled with over-engineering, interactivity galore, and the inconsistently consistent constant use
    of <code>transform</code>, <code>transition</code>, and <code>animation</code>
    <em>all over the place</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For me, there is nothing more boring and less personal than those kind of portfolios. They don't
    represent you or your skills - they just represent poor judgement and a lack of a design
    structure, unfortunately. Or that, which I assume is even more common, it is the result of a
    generic design culture that has been dominant for a while now <i
      >(I'm looking at you Tailwind and Shadcn!)</i
    > where everything has the same layout and by following that trend there's a sense that you have
    done it the right way. Followed the rules, so to speak.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Wrong!</strong></p>

  <p>
    That's conformity, not creativity. I'm not saying that people who decide to create portfolios
    like that lack skills. Far from it, and quite the opposite, but you should strive for creating
    websites people actually want to spend time on and read about you instead of being bombarded
    with movement and blinking things that makes you feel you are on a bad acid trip in Las Vegas
    with no recollection of how you even got there in the first place. No one sticks around on a
    portfolio site like that to actually learn about <em>you</em> and <em>your skills</em>. <strong
      >No one!</strong
    >.<br />
    Keep it clean and personal and let your skills show in your projects instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sorry about that, I just had to get it out of my system.<br />
    Anyway, let's get back to <em>this</em>
    portfolio. Shall we?<br />
    I landed on building it with <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> since the concept
    of a static site builder for content-heavy websites was exactly what I needed. No need for React
    or Next - just simple HTML, CSS and minimal JavaScript shipped to the client when and where needed.
    That's it.<br />
    With Astro's typed <a
      href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/modules/astro-content/"
      target="_blank">collections</a
    >, <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/layouts/" target="_blank" '>layouts</a>, image
    optimization, <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/" target="_blank">routing</a>,
    and <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#what-is-an-island" target="_blank"
      >island architecture</a
    >, building this project was a fantastic experience making this a fast loading and lean website
    without all the bloated bundles that comes with other frameworks and libraries.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <h4>Here's a quick summary of the tech I used</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span>&#10230; Build:</span> Astro, HTML, TypeScript, JavaScript.</li>
      <li><span>&#10230; Design:</span> Modular CSS, responsive layout and a DRY methodology.</li>
      <li><span>&#10230; Deployment:</span> Netlify.</li>
      <li>
        <span>&#10230; Images:</span>
        <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a> and <a
          href="https://www.rawpixel.com/">Rawpixel</a
        > (open source and free to use collections of photos and artwork).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>&#10230; CMS:</span> Simple flat-files and folders using .MD and .MDX for all posts, blogroll
        and other static content.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </aside>

  <h3>Typography</h3>
  <p>
    This was almost the hardest part of the design process. I think I spent way too much time
    getting lost in the myriad of fonts and combination of fonts than I'd have liked. But, I think
    it is a very important part of the brand of the site so it had to be done. Eventually, I think I
    struck a good balance that was pleasing for the eye and was a good match with my overall design
    vision.
    <br />
    I use <strong>Rubik</strong> by <a href="https://hfs-studio.com/" target="_blank"
      >Hubert & Fischer</a
    > as my main font combined with <strong>Packygreat</strong> by <a
      href="https://graphicxell.com/"
      target="_blank">Graphicxell</a
    > for all headings and, lastly, the beautiful <strong>CommitMono</strong> by <a
      href="https://commitmono.com/"
      target="_blank">Eigil Nikolajsen</a
    > for all mono demanding text (e.g the <code>code</code> and <small>small</small> tags) including
    some links and other bits around the site. It's by far my favourite mono style font and I use it
    in my terminal as well as my IDE.
  </p>
  <h3>The future</h3>
  <p>
    As for all projects, and I think it's even more true when it comes to your personal portfolio
    site, this will never be completely finished and I'm ok with that. In fact, I think there's
    value in that. You should keep your portfolio open to change and use it as a dumping ground for
    new things you learn along the way. This is your space, so why not use it as your private
    playground (in moderation, of course). Right?<br />
    I mean, as you keep developing and learn new things, use this project to implement them and tinker
    with what you have already accomplished. Improve it. Build on it. While we are at it, if you want
    to check out the <a href={REPO_URL} target="_blank">source code</a> for this portfolio, be my guest.
    You are welcome to steal, borrow, or copy anything you want <i>(no, not you bot!)</i> as long as
    you use it well and it helps you develop. Personally, I love looking at other people's code and figure
    out what they are doing and why. It's very educational.<br />
    <b>And remember: the internet is all about learning, sharing and connecting.</b>
  </p>
  <aside>
    <h4>So, here are some things that I will keep working on</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>&#10230; Fluid responsive design:</span> My goal is to fully implement a fluid responsive
        design to make the site scale better and more consistently. I really love the approach presented
        by <a href="https://utopia.fyi/" target="_blank">Utopia</a>. But I feel that I need to spend
        some time with it to really grasp it before I adapt it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>&#10230; Astro:</span> I'm very excited to keep digging deeper and learn more about it
        to improve this portfolio.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>&#10230; Reusability:</span> I know there are some things that I could easily turn into
        components that are now hard coded instead. My aim is to make this site as efficient and smooth
        as possible. In time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>&#10230; Logo:</span> I am quite decent when it comes to graphic design and things like
        that but logos, that's never been something I'm good at. If you happen to be good at it, or if
        you know someone who is, shoot me an email and let's work something out. I need a new logo.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>&#10230; Details:</span> Most of the things I will change will most likely go unnoticed
        because it won't affect the result in a way anyone will notice. It's all about tinkering and
        finding better and more efficient solutions to things.
      </li>
      <li>More to come...</li>
