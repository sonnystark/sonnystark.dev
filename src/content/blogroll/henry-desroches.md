title: 'Henry Desroches'
description: 'A place for rough drafts and indecipherable scrawling; for seedlings of ideas to be tended and stand tall in the fields.'
motivation: "I just love the creativity and eye for design that Henry displays throughout his works. His writings are always inspirational and each article is crafted with a clear goal: to educate and communicate. He balance the burden of artist and teacher immaculately."
