## An interesting journey

We're off! Alright, that's enough with the space travelling analogies. I've gotten it out my system now so, let's talk about why I'm really writing this blog post. It's mainly to welcome you all to my brand spanking new portfolio and blog website. If you are wondering about the space theme of this post it's because I built this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/). Also, because of the fact that the site is now online. Launched, if you will. So, you see, this works both ways.

I have been interested in building something with Astro for quite a while now so I was excited when I finally decided to build my own portfolio so I could really test it out and I absolutely recommend anyone to give it a go. If there's one thing I will take away from this experience, it's that Astro probably has the best and most well worked through documentation I have seen. It's just fantastic. Well structured, extremely easy to navigate, and the content of the documentation is just exemplary. I applaud the technical writers who created this and I am dreading engaging in any other documentation now when I have experienced this.

## An uncharted territory

I have never run a blog before. I think that as long as I can remember, I have found the idea of writing in general very appealing. I actually ran and published a small fanzine in my youth and I really enjoyed it but that was a very long time ago. Since then I have just written sporadically for a number of online magazines and things like that but nothing that would demanded any kind of continuity or structured submission schedule. I would just submit something when I had something written. But now, when I have actually built a blog, I want to actually utilise it and give it a real shot. I have no idea how it will go but I sure will try.

One thing that I dread a bit is to come up with ideas or topics to write about. Back when I did write it was easy because I would write about something I was (and still is) very passionate about. Music. I could whip up an album review in a heart beat or write up a music related column in no time because the inspiration was never far away. There were never a time where I felt that I had no idea what to write about since my entire life was about music. Going to shows, writing music, playing in bands, and touring formed the bedrock of my entire existence for many years. I was simply just writing what i was living. Simple.  
Now, though, I have a blog where I can really write whatever I want, which makes it a bit more difficult. At least that's what my brain is trying to tell me. It's like when you are playing a really good open world video game where you momentarily don't really feel like engaging in the main story so you start to explore side quests instead or simply just aimlessly explore the vast expansive realm you are in. Your options are endless. There are no boundaries or restrictions to what you can do but for me, at times, I end up going back to the main quest because I couldn't make up my mind. There were simply too many options and my imagination would spiral. Whether that is something you can relate to, or if that comparison even make any sense, I'm not sure but that is what I imagine my process to be when I can write and publish whatever I want. No guidelines or rules. I sure will try my best, though. I guess this is a start, at least.

## Impostorism

I read a lot of blogs and newsletters. I have an entire RSS feed full of extremely talented bloggers and writers, some of which you can check out over at my [Blogroll](/blogroll). Which you definitely should. Albeit inspiring, reading all these fantastic works can also spawn a feeling of not being good enough or, even worse, parachute you into a state of impostor syndrome. A mental cage that is incredibly difficult to break out of and overcome. It's so easy to compare yourself with others when entering a world that is unfamiliar to you. Where you haven't really found your _voice_ yet. A characterization of your writing that people can recognise. I assume that takes time to develop but as with most things in life, you have to practice to develop. Writing in a language that is not your mother tongue is most certainly also a factor in all this and it adds another layer of difficulty to the whole process.

Anyway, I have ranted long enough now and I thank you sincerely if you have managed to make it this far. I do hope you will find your way back here in the future.

All the best!
